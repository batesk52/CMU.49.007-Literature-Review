"Khaldi et al., 2016","This paper investigates the unexpectedly high etch rates observed during reactive ion etching (RIE) of conducting interpenetrating polymer networks (C‐IPNs) involving the conjugated polymer PEDOT. By individually studying the etching behavior of each component – including PEO, elastomers (PTHF, NBR) and PEDOT with various counterions – the authors demonstrate that oxygenated organic components (such as PEO and PTHF) play a key role in generating reactive hydroxyl radicals that accelerate the degradation of PEDOT. The work elucidates the synergetic chemical mechanisms responsible for the fast etching of PEDOT in a plasma environment and shows how this understanding can be exploited to pattern microactuators with high bending displacement.",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,
"Khodagholy et al., 2011","The paper reports on the design, fabrication, and in vivo testing of ultra‐thin, highly conformable electrode arrays based on PEDOT:PSS patterned on a 4 μm parylene C substrate. By directly patterning the conducting polymer rather than relying on electrochemical growth on metal electrodes, the authors demonstrate that these arrays, which incorporate Au interconnects and metal contact pads with a Ti adhesion layer, provide excellent mechanical flexibility and conformability to curved brain surfaces. In addition, the PEDOT:PSS electrodes show superior electrical performance and spatial resolution compared to conventional Au electrodes, as validated in electrocorticographic recordings in rat models. This work highlights the potential of conformable, polymer-based neural interfaces for minimally invasive bioelectronic applications.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,
"Middya et al., 2021","The paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of optically transparent microelectrode arrays (MEAs) that enable simultaneous high signal‐to‐noise electrophysiological recordings and advanced optical imaging, including calcium imaging and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). The electrodes are fabricated entirely from a PEDOT:PSS thin film patterned via conventional optical lithography on glass substrates. By optimizing the film thickness to around 380 nm, the devices achieve low impedance (approximately 56 ± 8 kΩ at 1 kHz) and over 75% transparency across the visible spectrum, allowing artifact‐free simultaneous laser illumination and neuronal recordings. The study demonstrates that these transparent MEAs support high resolution imaging of various neuronal biomarkers and can resolve sub‐diffraction features, paving the way for integrated multimodal studies in neuroscience.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,56 ± 8 kΩ
"Middya et al., 2025","This paper presents the development and in vivo evaluation of flexible microelectrocorticography (μECoG) arrays fabricated using PEDOT:PSS patterned on parylene C substrates. The arrays display low electrode impedance (averaging 38.9 ± 7.7 kΩ), enabling high-resolution single-neuron recordings from the cortical surface of rodents. They are also highly compatible with ultra‐high magnetic field MRI (9.4 T), generating minimal imaging artifacts, and support simultaneous electrical stimulation with BOLD fMRI. Overall, the work demonstrates a scalable, metal‐free neural interface that combines electrophysiology with advanced brain imaging.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,38.9 ± 7.7 kΩ
"Sessolo et al., 2013","This paper presents a novel, easy-to-fabricate method for producing microelectrode arrays (MEAs) based on conducting polymers. The authors detail a photolithography-based process that uses a mechanical peel‐off step to pattern both the conductive and insulating layers without resorting to harsh etching techniques. As a proof‐of-concept, they fabricated MEAs using PEDOT:PSS as the active electrode material and parylene-C as the insulating layer. The resulting devices demonstrated significantly lower impedance (approximately 23 kΩ at 1 kHz) compared to conventional gold electrodes, enabling high-quality extracellular recordings from rat hippocampal slices during pharmacological modulation. This versatile, low-cost fabrication process is promising for neuroprosthetic applications and drug screening platforms.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23 kΩ

"Khaldi et al., 2016","The paper investigates the chemical degradation mechanisms of PEDOT during reactive ion etching (RIE), focusing on its integration into conducting interpenetrating polymer network (C-IPN) actuators. It highlights the unexpectedly high etching rates of PEDOT-based materials due to a synergistic degradation process facilitated by the presence of oxygenated compounds in the polymer network. The study provides insights into the etching behavior of individual components like PEO, PTHF, and NBR, and proposes the use of fast etching processes for the fabrication of high-performance microactuators, demonstrating the operation of micro-beam actuators in air.",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,

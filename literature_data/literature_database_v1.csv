"Khaldi et al., 2016","This paper investigates the chemical etching mechanism of conducting interpenetrating polymer networks (C-IPNs) based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) during a reactive ion etching (RIE) process. The study reveals a synergetic degradation mechanism where oxygenated radicals released from the polymer network enhance the etching of PEDOT. The research demonstrates high etching rates for C-IPNs due to this mechanism, allowing for efficient microfabrication of electrochemical devices. The paper also explores the successful application of this etching process in fabricating PEDOT-based microactuators.",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,
"Khodagholy et al., 2011","The paper discusses the development of highly conformable conducting polymer electrodes for in vivo recordings, specifically targeting applications in electrocorticography (ECoG). The electrodes are made using PEDOT:PSS due to its high conductivity and biocompatibility, integrated onto a flexible parylene substrate. These electrodes are designed to conform to the brain's surface, offering less invasiveness compared to traditional silicon probes.

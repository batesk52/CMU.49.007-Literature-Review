The paper investigates the chemical degradation mechanisms of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) during the reactive ion etching (RIE) process, particularly focusing on its application in conducting interpenetrating polymer network (C-IPN) actuators. These actuators are promising for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) due to their high operational frequencies and mechanical flexibility.

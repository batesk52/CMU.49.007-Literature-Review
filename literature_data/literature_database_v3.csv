Instruction,"Add the Paper Reference, for example: Doe et al., 2024",Supply the year of publication. Do So in YYYY format. Only supply that information.,"Specify the college or research institution in which this research was performed. Simply supply the city, state or city, country if outside of the US. Keep the response simple and only to what I've asked.","Supply the charge storage capacity, CSC, in mC / cm^2. If you find the CSC given in another unit of measure, convert it and supply it here. If you are unsure about your response, please leave it blank.","Supply the charge injection capacity, CIC, in mC / cm^2. If you find the CSC given in another unit of measure, convert it and supply it here. If you are unsure about your response, please leave it blank.","Supply the transmittance in percentage. If you see it as a decimal, convert it to a percentage. If you are unsure, leave the row empty. ","Add the sheet resistance of the device, in Ohms per square. If the voltage is given in measured resistance, convert to sheet resistance with 4.531. If you are unsure, leave the row empty. ","Enter the maximum usable days for the electrode mentioned in the paper. If another unit is given, convert to days. If you are unsure, leave it empty.","Supply the electrode material. Ex. Gold, PEDOT:PSS, ITO. Err on the side of brief when explaining. If you can't write a simple answer, leave it blank.","Supply the substrate material. Ex.PMDS, Parylene C, SU-8. Err on the side of brief when explaining. If you can't write a simple answer, leave it blank.","If GABA is sensed in the paper, enter Y. Else, enter N. If you are unsure, leave it blank. ",
